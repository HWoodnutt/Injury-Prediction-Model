# Injury Prediction Model Project

In this project, we explore the possibility of predicting an individual player’s injury risk for upcoming seasons. We aim to classify players into “Low,” “Medium,” and “High” risk categories based on their bio data, historical injury records, and load data.

The primary goal of this project is to provide medical department decision-makers with an initial overview of a player’s potential injury risk, informed by the factors considered.
