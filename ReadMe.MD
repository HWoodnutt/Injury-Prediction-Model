# Injury Prediction Model Project

In this project we explore the possibility of prediciting Injury Risk of an individual player for upcoming seasons. We attempt to classify players in to "Low", "Medium", "High" risk categories based on their Bio Data, Historical Injury Records, and Load Data.
The main goal of this project is to provide key decision makers within Medical departments a first glance categorisation of a player's potential injury risk based on the factors accounted for.
